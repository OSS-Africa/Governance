## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct also applies to behavior outside of community spaces when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.

## Enforcement Procedures

### Types of Corrective Actions

Depending on the severity and nature of the violation, the following corrective actions may be taken:

#### 1. Correction
**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning
**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media.

#### 3. Temporary Ban
**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved is allowed during this period.

#### 4. Permanent Ban
**Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

### Enforcement Considerations

When determining appropriate corrective action, maintainers will consider:

- The impact of the behavior on the community and individuals
- The severity and nature of the violation
- The history and pattern of behavior by the individual
- The intent behind the behavior
- The response and accountability shown by the individual

All enforcement decisions will be documented internally for consistency and future reference.

## Non-Retaliation Policy

OSSAfrica prohibits retaliation against any individual who:

- Reports a potential violation of this Code of Conduct
- Participates in an investigation of reported misconduct
- Advocates for enforcement of community standards

Retaliation includes any adverse action taken because someone has engaged in protected activity under this policy. Retaliation itself constitutes a violation of this Code of Conduct and will result in appropriate corrective action.

## Appeals Process

Individuals who believe they have been wrongfully accused or inappropriately sanctioned may appeal enforcement decisions by:

1. Submitting a written appeal to [APPEALS_EMAIL] within 30 days of the decision
2. Providing new information or evidence relevant to the case
3. Explaining why they believe the decision was incorrect or disproportionate

Appeals will be reviewed by [GOVERNANCE_BODY] or designated appeals committee members who were not involved in the original decision. The appeals process will be completed within 21 days, and the decision will be communicated in writing.

Final decisions on appeals rest with the designated governance authorities and are binding.

## Updates and Versioning

1. Submitted via pull request to this repository
2. Reviewed by the Core Team and community members
3. Subject to a public comment period of at least 14 days
