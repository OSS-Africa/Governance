# OSSAfrica Governance Repository

## An Open Community Initiative

This repository contains the governance framework, organizational structure, policies, and operational documents for **Open Source & Security Africa (OSSAfrica)**.
It is intended as the authoritative source for how the community operates, makes decisions, and evolves over time by providing documentation that guides governance,
leadership, and community practices.

## Overview

Open Source & Security Africa (OSSAfrica) is a community-driven initiative focused on strengthening open source collaboration, security awareness, and
contributor engagement across Africa. Our governance model draws heavily from practices established by the **Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF)**
and the **Linux Foundation (LF)** - prioritizing transparency, fairness, openness, and community participation.

## **Mission**

To build a secure, collaborative, and thriving open source ecosystem across Africa by empowering contributors, security professionals, developers, and communities 
with education, tooling, mentorship, and sustainable governance.

## **Scope**

This repository covers:

* Governance framework & operating model
* Working group charters
* Leadership responsibilities & processes
* Community expectations & participation guidelines
* Onboarding processes
* Communications, moderation, and conduct policies
* Templates, meeting notes, and operational documents

## **Principles**

OSSAfrica governance aligns with the following values:

* **Open participation:** Anyone may join, contribute, or participate.
* **Transparent governance:** Decisions, meetings, and processes are documented and accessible.
* **Community-first leadership:** Roles are earned through contribution and sustained engagement.
* **Meritocratic evolution:** Leadership evolves as contributors demonstrate initiative and responsibility.
* **Neutral, vendor-agnostic operations:** No single company or entity controls OSSAfrica.
* **Security-focused culture:** Our operations emphasize safe, responsible engagement with open source security.

## Governance Structure

At this stage, OSSAfrica operates with a streamlined governance model designed to ensure clarity, accountability, and
alignment with the broader open source security ecosystem:

* **OpenSSF BEAR Working Group**: Serves as the governing body, providing strategic guidance, mentorship, and ensuring that OSSAfrica’s
activities align with global open source security standards and initiatives.
* **OSSAfrica Special Interest Group (SIG)**: Acts as the operational liaison between the Core Team and the BEAR Working Group, driving
community growth, coordinating administrative efforts, and facilitating alignment with governance priorities.
* **Core Team**: Responsible for day-to-day management, operational decision-making, coordination of community activities, and engagement with contributors.
The Core Team implements strategies approved by the SIG and ensures the smooth functioning of OSSAfrica initiatives.

As OSSAfrica evolves, additional working groups and formal leadership roles may be established to focus on specialized missions such as community outreach,
security research, educational programs, and regional or country-specific chapters. This flexible structure allows the organization to scale while maintaining clear governance and accountability.
