# **OSSAfrica Governance & Community Framework**

*An Open Community Initiative Aligned with Linux Foundation & OpenSSF Principles*

---

## **Overview**

**Open Source & Security Africa (OSSAfrica)** is a community-driven initiative dedicated to strengthening open source collaboration, security awareness, and contributor growth across the African continent. Our governance model draws heavily from practices established by the **Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF)** and the **Linux Foundation (LF)**—prioritizing transparency, fairness, openness, and community participation.

This repository provides the authoritative source for OSSAfrica’s organizational structure, working groups, governance processes, and documentation that guide how we operate as an open community.

---

## **Mission**

To build a secure, collaborative, and thriving open source ecosystem across Africa by empowering contributors, security professionals, developers, and communities with education, tooling, mentorship, and sustainable governance.

---

## **Scope**

This repository covers:

* Governance framework & operating model
* Working group charters
* Leadership responsibilities & election processes
* Community expectations & participation guidelines
* Onboarding processes
* Communications, moderation, and conduct policies
* Templates, meeting notes, and operational documents

---

## **Principles**

OSSAfrica governance aligns with Linux Foundation and OpenSSF values:

* **Open participation:** Anyone may join, contribute, or participate.
* **Transparent governance:** Decisions, meetings, and processes are documented and accessible.
* **Community-first leadership:** Roles are earned through contribution and sustained engagement.
* **Meritocratic evolution:** Leadership evolves as contributors demonstrate initiative and responsibility.
* **Neutral, vendor-agnostic operations:** No single company or entity controls OSSAfrica.
* **Security-focused culture:** Our operations emphasize safe, responsible engagement with open source security.

---

## **Governance Structure**

OSSAfrica operates under a multi-layer leadership model inspired by OpenSSF Working Groups.

### **1. Core Team**

The Core Team oversees organizational alignment, strategy, partnerships, and overall cross-community coordination.

Responsibilities:

* Maintain governance documentation
* Approve working group charters
* Ensure neutral, inclusive operations
* Facilitate long-term strategic direction
* Liaise with OpenSSF and other partners

---

### **2. Advisory Council**

A group of experienced open source and security leaders who guide strategic decisions and provide oversight.

Responsibilities:

* Offer non-binding strategic advice
* Ensure alignment with open source best practices
* Support partnerships, policy alignment, and ecosystem growth

---

### **3. Working Groups (WGs)**

Modeled after OpenSSF WGs, each WG focuses on a specific mission area.

Current examples:

* **Community & Outreach**
* **Security & Research**
* **Developer Experience & Tooling**
* **Education & Training**
* **Events & Programs**
* **Regional Chapters**
* **Communications & Content**

Each WG has:

* A **Charter**
* A **Lead** and optional **Co-Lead**
* Regular meetings (open to all)
* Documented goals and deliverables

WG decisions are made by consensus; escalations go to the Core Team.

---

## **Decision-Making Process**

OSSAfrica follows a consensus-based model inspired by the Linux Foundation:

1. **General consensus** within Working Groups
2. If unresolved → discussion with Core Team
3. If still unresolved → escalated to Advisory Council
4. Final resolution prioritizes:

   * Community impact
   * Transparency
   * Long-term sustainability
   * Security and safety

All decisions, discussions, and votes must be documented.

---

Everyone is welcome to:

* Join meetings
* Participate in discussions
* Contribute documentation, code, or research
